# Stephen Checkoway's tenure material

My research efforts have been focused around several different areas of
computer security. I have grouped a selection of my publications by area
below, sorted by date. Papers marked with \* were written during graduate
school. My CV is available [here](cv.pdf) and all of my papers are available
[here](https://checkoway.net/papers).

  Programming and the AVC Advantage](evt2009.pdf).\* 2009 Electronic Voting
  Technologies Workshop/Workshop on Trustworthy Elections.

## Low-level software security
A second theme of my research focuses on low-level software attacks like
return-oriented programming and defenses like control-flow integrity.

- [Can DREs Provide Long-Lasting Security? The Case of Return-Oriented
  Programming and the AVC Advantage](evt2009.pdf).\* 2009 Electronic Voting
  Technologies Workshop/Workshop on Trustworthy Elections.

## Network security
A third theme of my research has examined aspects of the security of network
protocols including Transportation Layer Security (TLS), Internet Key Exchange
(IKE), and OpenID Connect.
